# BeeVibe API

## Introduction
BeeVibe API that interfaces with IoT devices to gather real-time data used for monitoring and analyzing the health and environment of beehives.

## Key Features
- CRUD operations for apiary management.
- Data collection from various sensors including weight, temperature, humidity, and audio sensors.
- Nested routing for accessing hives associated with an apiary.
- Data upload endpoints for 4G-enabled apiary hubs.

## Technologies Used
- Django & Django REST Framework for the API construction.
- MySQL as the database backend.
- Pytest for behavior-driven development and testing.
- JWT for secure authentication.
- Additional Django packages for enhanced functionality (e.g., django-filter, drf-nested-routers, django-debug-toolbar).

## API Endpoints
A detailed list of available endpoints and their HTTP methods, along with the expected input and output formats, will be documented internally for development purposes.

## Installation
For internal use only, the installation process is managed by the development team.

## Testing
Testing is done using Pytest with a focus on behavior-driven tests. Tests will cover all aspects of the API to ensure it meets functional requirements and handles data validation properly.

## Versioning
The project is in active development, and versioning will be managed according to the internal release schedule.
